# Greentube Test Assignment

The task was to implement a new .Net Core web service that allows players to log in in case theyâ€™ve forgotten their current password simply by knowing the email address they used at registration (which is unique for each player).

## Security considerations

* One potential vulnerability is unauthorized access to an email address, which could allow attackers to reset another person's password.
* Additional authentication measures may be necessary to verify the person requesting the password reset is the actual account owner.
* A limit on password reset attempts within a certain time period could help prevent brute force attacks.
* Denial of service attacks could occur, overwhelming the server with requests. Rate limiting or IP blocking measures could be implemented to prevent this.
* Passwords must be securely stored and transmitted using strong encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.
